# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects through a clear, stage-gated lifecycle that moves from initiation to planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation centers on a lightweight Project One-pager to capture the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, and an initial risk list. Planning breaks approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog, defines a Definition of Done, identifies dependencies and mitigations, and produces a release plan and milestone map. Key artifacts across these stages include the Project Charter/One-pager, backlog with acceptance criteria, a risk register, and release notes.

Workflows emphasize small, incremental delivery and a standardized pull request flow: use the project board with columns (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), keep PRs small, link issues and acceptance criteria, run CI checks, and require approvals before merging. Planning and execution are timeboxed into sprints/iterations with a capacity-aware planning process and a backlog template that includes estimates, priority, and owners. Risk and dependency management is continuous—items are captured in a Risk Register with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation and escalated through defined paths when they become blockers.

Roles and personas are explicitly defined so ownership and responsibilities are clear: Product Managers define outcomes and success metrics; Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; developers implement and test; and QA/testing validates acceptance criteria. The PM and PdM maintain weekly alignment, delivery teams run daily standups and sprint demos, and stakeholders receive monthly or milestone-based updates. Escalation paths are tiered from team-level triage to PM → Product Lead → Sponsor, with a separate path for security incidents.

Quality assurance is baked into CI and the release process: unit and integration tests for code changes, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, automated security scanning in CI, and manual QA where required. Pre-release requirements include passing CI/security scans, drafted release notes, a rollback/mitigation plan, and smoke tests on staging before production deployment. Post-release, teams run verifications and capture lessons in retrospectives, turning action items into tracked backlog tasks to measure improvement over time.

How to use these docs: See the individual process docs in this folder (e.g., octoacme-project-initiation.md, octoacme-project-planning.md, octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) for detailed guidance. Keep the Project One-pager and the Risk Register up to date in the project repo; use the project board as the single source of truth for status.
